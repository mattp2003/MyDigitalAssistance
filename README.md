# MyDigitalAssistance

This is INF133 A3-A5 project by Matthew Phan (phannm) and Mukarram Ali (mukarraa).

Milestones:

## A3

- [ ] A high level description of “what” features your final project will aim to deliver
- [ ] Keeping in mind the HCI perspective, you might also include details about your target user group OR users' context.
    * This point was inspired by a question one of you asked in class and may help you think about a specific group of users or a specific context. This team is aiming to create a Digital assistant solution to help members of a household. This team might then think of both the context (i.e. household activities that need to be managed/tracked and the different members of a typical household.  
    * As another example: you might develop a Personal digital assistant to help UCI students manage their quarterly activities at school. Here, your target users are UCI students like yourself and the context could include typical activities during a quarter. 
    * Whatever target user group and context you choose, please include some information about this so we can provide you feedback and perhaps help you scope your project. 
- [ ] Names of students (in pairs)
- [ ] Any Templates you will build on as reference
